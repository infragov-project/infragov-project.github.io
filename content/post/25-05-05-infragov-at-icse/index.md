InfraGov research team members Alexandra Mendes and João F. Ferreira attended ICSE 2025, the premier conference for Software Engineering research. During the event, they engaged in multiple work meetings, actively promoting the InfraGov project and sharing updates on its current progress.

ICSE 2025 also served as a hub for international researchers focused on Infrastructure as Code (IaC), many of whom organized meetings around the topic. Alexandra and João participated in these discussions, using the opportunity to present InfraGov’s goals and preliminary results. Valuable feedback gathered during these sessions will help refine key project tasks and guide future developments.

[ICSE 2025, the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2025), brought together leading researchers, practitioners, and educators from around the world to share the latest advances in software engineering. Held in Ottawa, Canada, the conference featured a rich program of keynotes, technical papers, workshops, and community events, fostering collaboration across academia and industry.
