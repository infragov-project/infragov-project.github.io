The InfraGov team will present two new research papers this summer at leading international conferences in software engineering: one introducing InfraFix, a novel tool for repairing Infrastructure as Code across technologies, and another reporting the first large-scale empirical study of contract usage and evolution in Android apps—laying the groundwork for similar analysis in IaC.

At **ISSTA 2025**, we will present _InfraFix: Technology-Agnostic Repair of Infrastructure as Code_, a tool demonstration paper introducing InfraFix, the first automated repair framework capable of handling IaC scripts written in multiple technologies (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Terraform). With its modular architecture and scalable design, InfraFix successfully repairs over 95% of 250,000+ generated scenarios derived from real-world IaC repositories. This work supports InfraGov's mission of improving automation reliability through actionable repair.

At **ECOOP 2025**, we will present _Contract Usage and Evolution in Android Mobile Applications_, the first large-scale empirical study on the use and evolution of design-by-contract constructs in Android apps written in Java and Kotlin. Although focused on mobile software, this research provides valuable insights into how contracts evolve over time, the risks of unsafe specification changes, and the importance of annotations and language-level features for promoting software correctness, all of which inform InfraGov’s broader goals of detecting and preventing configuration regressions in IaC. We chose Android as a case study to reuse and become familiar with an existing contract analysis framework, with the goal of adapting it next to study similar specification and evolution issues in Infrastructure as Code.

Both papers reflect InfraGov’s commitment to building a principled and practical foundation for reliable infrastructure automation.
